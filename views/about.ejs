                Creating a blog application using Node.js and Express.js is one of the most practical and rewarding ways to understand backend web development. With the power of Node.js, a runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, developers can write server-side code using JavaScript, the language theyâ€™re likely already using on the frontend. Express.js, a minimalist and flexible framework for Node, simplifies routing, middleware management, and server setup, making it perfect for web apps like blogs.
